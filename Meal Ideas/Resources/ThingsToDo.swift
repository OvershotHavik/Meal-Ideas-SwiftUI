/*
 Search for ToDo's throughout the project, been adding things here and there as well
 
 - Figure out Search for the list
 
 - Setup the form for the user to create meals
    - Figure out how to do plists for custom ingredients and sides and categories
 
 - Setup Network Calls instead of using the mock data for the mealdb and spoon
 
 get each query to work
 - Random
 - Category
 - Ingredient
 - Keyword
 - Favorite
 - History
 
 - Figure out a better way to do the top view that isn't so buggy
    - Maybe figure out an actual tab view instead of the one I made? not sure if they can be up in the app view like that
 
 - Figure out text fields background so it stays white in dark mode
 
 - Figure out how to do history and favorites
  
 - Figure out the "large picture view" when user clicks on the meal photo
  
 - maybe change the background color of the top view depending on which source? orange for meal db and green for spoon?
 
 - Add the loading spinner when network calls are going
    - Add the placeholder image for when nothing is found
 
 - Add an "OffSet" value for spoon so it will get additional meals after first 10 are shown.
 
 - Have the option to load more meals for my meals and mealdb, and have it show something when all are shown
