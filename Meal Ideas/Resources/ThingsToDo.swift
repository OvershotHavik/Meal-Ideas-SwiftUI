 Search for ToDo's throughout the project, been adding things here and there as well
  
 - Setup the form for the user to create meals
    - Figure out how to do core data for custom ingredients and sides and categories
    - make meal name required, and put a check in to verify the name doesn't exist already, and modify favorites accordingly, pass in favorite when editing the meal for easier access
    - Add Date Created and Last Modified on fields to the form
 

 Favorites -
 Figure out why when unfavorited it bounces right back to the list, I thought it would at least stay there and then when user hit back it would go back to the list where it is no longer listed..
 
 - Favorite - using core data now
    - Add a heart icon in the tool bar for each source, and list them in a list view, then have them go to the meal when clicked. Will need to create a new list view for that since navigating away instead of back like the rest are .
    - Modify the favorites when editing the meal, if the name changes or deletes correct it in the favorites array as well
    - Add a date to the favorite so that I may eventually ad an option to sort by date added
    - Add a favorite heart next to the meal name for user meals list when they go to edit it a swell.
 
 - History
    - Add the book icon on each source and list them in a list view, then have them go to the meal when clicked.
    - Offer the option to delete per row, and to delete groups like All, older than 90 days, 60, 30, 7
    - Filter the history so it only shows the most recent? or leave it alone.. not sure yet. 
 
 - Figure out a better way to do the top view that isn't so buggy
    - Maybe figure out an actual tab view instead of the one I made? not sure if they can be up in the app view like that
 
 - Figure out text fields background so it stays white in dark mode

  
 - Figure out the "large picture view" when user clicks on the meal photo
  
 - maybe change the background color of the top view depending on which source? orange for meal db and green for spoon?
  
 - Add an "OffSet" value for spoon so it will get additional meals after first 10 are shown.
