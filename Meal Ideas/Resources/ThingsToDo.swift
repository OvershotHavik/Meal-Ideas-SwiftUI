/*
 - Figure out Search for the list
 - Figure out if possible to pop the view once the "Done" button is pressed after the selection is made, if not user can just go back..  would be nice to change the background, or have a check mark next to the one selected
 - Setup the form for the user to create meals
    -figure out how to pass data back and forth between the form and the selection 
    -Figure out core data to store said meals
    - Figure out how to do plists for custom ingredients and sides and categories
 - Setup Network Calls instead of using the mock data for the mealdb and spoon
 - Figure out text fields background so it stays white in dark mode
 - Setup the category picker, which should just be a list/forEach loop to allow just one for the query, but will need changed for when user is creating a meal
    -Maybe just do a popup list when the query it, but bring up a list when creating a meal?
 - Figure out how to do history and favorites
 - Add an the HStack view for the spoon meals for the servings and time to prepare like I did in original version
 - Figure out the "large picture view" when user clicks on the meal photo
 - Change the selection Text to include the ingredient image next to the name
 - maybe change the background color of the top view depending on which source? orange for meal db and green for spoon?
 - Add the loading spinner when network calls are going
    - Add the placeholder image for when nothing is found
 - Add an "OffSet" value for spoon so it will get additional meals after first 10 are shown.
 - Have the option to load more meals for my meals and mealdb, and have it show something when all are shown
