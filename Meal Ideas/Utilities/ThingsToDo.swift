/*
 Search for ToDo's throughout the project, been adding things here and there as well
  
 - [ ] Add some form of statement that we are not responsible for the pictures stored in the app
 
 - [ ] Animate the meal cards appearing /disappearing
 - [ ] Add haptics when meal card appear? So the phone vibrates when they come in? Just a subtle one to go with the animation?
 Maybe set the gradient as the background view for the main views for each source? Then the top view could be clear.  Maybe give the scroll view a black/white background?

 
 Once these are done:
 - [ ] Threading issue for the picture and why it doesnâ€™t circle all the time
 - [ ] How to handle access photos so users can allow album
 
 move back to the minimum view for top view and add these:
 
 - [ ] When user taps surprise me, run the random, get the first meal and take them straight to the detail view for that meal
 - [ ] When scroll down hide the top bar and then show it again once the user starts scrolling back up
 
 
 possible image modifier
 
 .resizable()
 .clipShape(Circle())
 .frame(width: 200, height: 200)
 .overlay(Circle().stroke(Color.white,lineWidth:4).shadow(radius: 10))
 
 
 adds a white border and a shadow effeect

/*
 Future versions
 - [ ] Figure out how to get the amount of times a meal has been favorites in CloudKit and display it under an open heart on the meal card. For future release
 - [ ] Add ability for user to add their own categories, ingredients, and sides
     - [ ] Like cookies or frozen meal
 - [ ] Offer the ability to share user meals?
 - [ ] Offer a filter button to offer the user to specify multiple query at once. Could include name, category, ingredient, prep time, servings.. would only apply where the source provides that info though
 - [ ] Make it comparable with iPad
 - [ ] Offer expert to json
 - [ ] Offer ability to select ingredients to add them to a list to be able to share, like I did with original version
 - [ ] Offer the option to change the gradient colors in a settings menu
