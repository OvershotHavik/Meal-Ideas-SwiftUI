//Notepad for what still needs worked on or where I left off etc...

/*
 Search for ToDo's throughout the project, been adding things here and there as well
  

 Favorites -
 Figure out why when unfavorited it bounces right back to the list, I thought it would at least stay there and then when user hit back it would go back to the list where it is no longer listed..
  

 - [ ] Only allow x amount of meals to be stored then offer the pro version which will block adds and unlock unlimited meal storage

 */
// TODO:  make a list

//FIXME: fix this


/*
 Future relese plans:
 - Figure out how to do core data for custom ingredients and sides and categories
 
 
 - Filter the history so it only shows the most recent? or leave it alone.. not sure yet. Maybe give it an option in the settings section to filter history to only show the most recent viewing of the meal
 
 - [ ] Figure out how to get the amount of times a meal has been favorites in CloudKit and display it under an open heart on the meal card. For future release
 - [ ] Add ability for user to add their own categories, ingredients, and sides
     - [ ] Like cookies or frozen meal
 - [ ] Offer the ability to share user meals?
 - [ ] Offer a filter button to offer the user to specify multiple query at once. Could include name, category, ingredient, prep time, servings.. would only apply where the source provides that info though
