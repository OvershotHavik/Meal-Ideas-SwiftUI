/*
 Search for ToDo's throughout the project, been adding things here and there as well
  

  

 - [ ] Only allow x amount of meals to be stored then offer the pro version which will block adds and unlock unlimited meal storage

 - [ ] Adds for mealdb and spoon to help cover the api costs
 - [ ] Animate the meal cards appearing /disappearing
 - [ ] Add haptics when meal card appear? So the phone vibrates when they come in? Just a subtle one to go with the animation?
 - [ ] Add this Same color to the background of text fields if they still stand out
 */
// TODO:  make a list

//FIXME: fix this


/*
 Future relese plans:
 - Figure out how to do core data for custom ingredients and sides and categories
 
 
 - Filter the history so it only shows the most recent? or leave it alone.. not sure yet. Maybe give it an option in the settings section to filter history to only show the most recent viewing of the meal
 
 - [ ] Figure out how to get the amount of times a meal has been favorites in CloudKit and display it under an open heart on the meal card. For future release
 - [ ] Add ability for user to add their own categories, ingredients, and sides
     - [ ] Like cookies or frozen meal
 - [ ] Offer the ability to share user meals?
 - [ ] Offer a filter button to offer the user to specify multiple query at once. Could include name, category, ingredient, prep time, servings.. would only apply where the source provides that info though
